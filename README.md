# Hi, I'm Ekjyot Singh Shinh ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate computer science student at California State University, Sacramento, with a strong interest in software engineering, algorithms, and deep learning. I am actively seeking new opportunities to contribute to the tech field and continuously grow as a developer.

Currently, I am working on **ChemTrack**, a mobile app designed to help educational institutions manage their chemical inventories, ensuring safety and efficiency. Additionally, Iâ€™m diving into deep learning with PyTorch and exploring parallel computing using CUDA to optimize complex processes.

In my role as a **Software Developer Intern** at the **Office of Water Programs**, I've worked on engineering secure systems and optimizing backend processes to enhance user experience. Iâ€™m also conducting research on parallel algorithms for the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP) solver, aiming to increase the speed and efficiency of algorithms.

Feel free to explore my repositories, or reach out to me if youâ€™re interested in collaborating, discussing tech, or just having a chat!
