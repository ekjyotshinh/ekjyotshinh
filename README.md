# Hi, I'm Ekjyot Singh Shinh 👋

I’m a Software Developer and Computer Science graduate from California State University, Sacramento (GPA 3.92) with experience building production-grade backend systems, distributed services, and full-stack applications. I’m passionate about system design, high-performance computing, and building scalable software.

I’m currently working as a Software Developer at the Office of Water Programs, where I build secure backend services, payment systems, microservices, and distributed components used across multiple production applications.

Alongside my work, I conduct research in parallel Branch & Bound algorithms for the Sequential Ordering Problem (SOP), improving performance through load balancing and LKH-based optimization techniques.

Feel free to explore my repositories, or reach out to me if you’re interested in collaborating, discussing tech, or just having a chat!
